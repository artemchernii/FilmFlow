# FilmFlow

FilmFlow is a side project that I developed during my JSMastery course, aimed at honing my skills in modern web development. This project served as a practical playground for exploring and implementing various technologies and best practices.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** Leveraged the power of React for building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Redux and RTK Query:** Implemented Redux for state management and used RTK Query for efficient API integration, simplifying data fetching and updates.
- **Create React App:** Initiated the project with Create React App for a quick and scalable setup.
- **Material UI:** Designed a visually appealing and user-friendly interface using Material UI components.
- **Axios:** Utilized Axios for handling HTTP requests, ensuring seamless communication between the frontend and backend.
- **Jest and React Testing Library:** Practiced test-driven development by writing unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library to ensure code reliability.
- **Husky and Git Hooks:** Maintained code quality through pre-commit and pre-push Git hooks using Husky, enforcing best practices and automated checks.
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Integrated CI to automate testing processes and maintain code integrity.

## Additional Features

- **TMDb API Integration:** FilmFlow integrates with [The Movie Database (TMDb) API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to fetch comprehensive movie data, including details, images, and user ratings.

- **TMDb Authentication:** Secure and personalized user experiences are enabled through TMDb login authentication. Users can enjoy features like saving favorites and managing watchlists.


## Project Structure

The project is organized with a focus on modularity and maintainability. Here's a brief overview of the key directories:

- **src/components:** Contains reusable React components for building the UI.
- **src/features:** Organizes Redux slices and associated logic for different features.
- **src/services:** Manages API services and data fetching using Axios.
- **src/tests:** Hosts unit tests to ensure the reliability of the codebase.
